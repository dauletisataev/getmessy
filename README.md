# nuschedule


app was built for students to effictively plan their daily ansd weekly schedule. This application was inspired by Google Calendar. 
The problem of students at Nazarbayev University was to manually type every lesson into their calendar app from the PDF file of schedule provided by the university. Therefore, I decided to create new app that will parse their schedule automatically and provide the same feature as other well-developed calendar apps.

# Screens 
These are how app looks like in use.
    First one is Schedule view. 
    Second is Day timetable view.
    Third is Week schedule view.
    Last one is how a new lesson is added.
